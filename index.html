  Of course, improving Software Quality

  Defensive programming, simply put, is programming with the intent to anticipate likely failure points. 
  
  The goal is to circumvent those likely problems before they occur.
  
  The Wikipedia entry goes on to say that defensive programming is one approach to improving software quality by “Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected input or user actions.”

.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
### - Conditional Statement
]
.right-column[
This is one of the easiest places to program defensively, and one where it’s easiest to be complacent. 

In many cases while programming in PHP, you simply won’t need an “else” case

```remark
if($var == a){ 
  //do something
}else if($var == b){
  //do something 
}else if($var == c){
  //do something
}

```
 I know that you know there are no other possibilities. But sometimes (unexpected) things happen.
 
 Make use of else blocks. Make use of default in switches. 

 Use them to return or log an error so that you’re aware of what’s happened, should it ever happen. 
 It may be an extra couple of lines of code, but it’s worth it when something happens that you did not expect.

]
---
.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
  ### - Conditional Statement
  ### - Never Trust User Input
]
.right-column[
  Have you heard this statement? Most of us have. We should never trust user input.

  This doesn't mean that all users are the hackers that will destroy your code (but, this is possible)

  Assume that users don't know your code, what parameter you need, the format or how long the input can be.
  They don't know what file type can upload, or what size.

  Or maybe they are hackers that want to upload script that destroy your masterpiece.

  So, NEVER TRUST USER INPUT
  --
  - Always VALIDATE the user input

  - Ensure that you're using appropriate techniques when handling the data, especially when storing or retrieving to/from databases

]
---
.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
  ### - Conditional Statement
  ### - Never Trust User Input
]
.right-column[
  There are many methods by which to validate user input safely.

  Typecasting is an interesting way to “validate” user input. Sometimes it goes a bit like this:

```remark
  $member->property = (int) $_GET['property'];
```
But, the problem is, we are not really checking the input, just forcing it

Basically, that comes out like this:
```remark
  $member->property = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'property', 
  FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);

  if (false === $member->property) {
    throw new Exception('Property was not an int');
  }

```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
  ### - Conditional Statement
  ### - Never Trust User Input
  ### - Assumptions About Your Code
]
.right-column[
  Don’t assume anything. 

  If the previous two topics teach us anything, it’s that we should not make any assumptions.

  As programmers, especially when focusing on a single project for too long, we begin to assume a lot.

  We assume that the user will know everything, we assume that the user will not do the dumb thing, because...we already know that fact

  Even, we assume that everything will be handled by our frontend friend, 
  but obviously you still deal with user behavior and user input in the back-end as well, so it’s worth thinking about.

  FOLLOW the Coding GUIDELINES!!

  Coding guideline is a standard coding elements that are required to ensure a high level of technical interoperability between shared PHP code.

  You can check it later [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1//)

  That is a recommendation, the key is consistency. 

  However, whether you’re coding to some set of standards or not, you should at very least be internally consistent – because it will make you less error prone

  ### - Try and Catch
]
.right-column[
  try/catch statements are another hot topic among PHP developers.

```remark
  try {
    if($member->property <= 0){
      throw new Exception("Value must be 1 or greater");
    }
    // If no exception was thrown, this will be output.
    echo "The value is acceptable";
  } catch(Exception $e) {
    echo 'Message: '.$e->getMessage();
  }


```

.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
]
.right-column[
To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few Markdown extensions have been included:

- Slide properties, for naming, styling and templating slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
]
.right-column[
Initial lines containing key-value pairs are extracted as slide properties:

```remark
name: agenda
class: middle, center

# Agenda

The name of this slide is {{ name }}.
```

Slide properties serve multiple purposes:

* Naming and styling slides using properties `name` and `class`

* Using slides as templates using properties `template` and `layout`

* Expansion of `{{ property }}` expressions to property values

See the [complete list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#slide-properties) of slide properties.
]

.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
  ### - Content classes
]
.right-column[
Any occurences of one or more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

```remark
.footnote[.red.bold[*] Important footnote]
```

Resulting HTML extract:

```xml
<span class="footnote">
  <span class="red bold">*</span> Important footnote
</span>
```
]

.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
  ### - Content classes
  ### - Syntax Highlighting
]
.right-column[
Code blocks can be syntax highlighted by specifying a language from the set of [supported languages](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting).

Using [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) fenced code blocks you can easily specify highlighting language:

.pull-left[

<pre><code>```javascript
function add(a, b)
  return a + b
end
```</code></pre>
]
.pull-right[

<pre><code>```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end
```</code></pre>
]

A number of highlighting [styles](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting) are available, including several well-known themes from different editors and IDEs.

  ## Presenter mode
]
.right-column[
To help out with giving presentations, a presenter mode comprising the
following features is provided:

- Display of slide notes for the current slide, to help you remember
  key points

- Display of upcoming slide, to let you know what's coming

- Cloning of slideshow for viewing on extended display
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
  ### - Inline notes
]
.right-column[
Just like three dashes separate slides,
three question marks separate slide content from slide notes:

```
Slide 1 content

*???

Slide 1 notes

---

Slide 2 content

*???

Slide 2 notes
```

Slide notes are also treated as Markdown, and will be converted in the
same manner slide content is.

Pressing __P__ will toggle presenter mode.
]
???
Congratulations, you just toggled presenter mode!

Now press __P__ to toggle it back off.
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
  ### - Inline notes
  ### - Cloned view
]
.right-column[
Presenter mode of course makes no sense to the audience.

Creating a cloned view of your slideshow lets you:

- Move the cloned view to the extended display visible to the audience

- Put the original slideshow in presenter mode

- Navigate as usual, and the cloned view will automatically keep up with the original

Pressing __C__ will open a cloned view of the current slideshow in a new
browser window.
